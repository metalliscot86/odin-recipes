        <p>It's time for lunch and you haven't thought about it until you realize you're going to
            die if you don't eat right now. There's no time to preheat the oven and the deep
            fryer has been quarantined. <strong>What are you to do?</strong></p>
    <h3>Grab what you got</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You'll need a plate and some flatware (Just grab whatever. We don't know what's 
                going to happen)</li>
            <li>Check the fridge for any food you already cooked and put it on the plate.
                (This is no time to be picky, you're starving)</li>
            <li>Seasoning (Salt, ketchup, hot sauce, whatever you like)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>What to do</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put it in the microwave and cook away.</li>
            <li>It'll have to sit for a bit because it's going to be so hot you will likely 
                burn yourself if you eat it now.</li>
            <li>Use whatever tools at your disposal to shovel it in quickly.</li>
        </ol>
